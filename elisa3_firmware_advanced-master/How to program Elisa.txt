This documentation is a How to Program Elisa3 robots from a Windows 10 computer
for more information on how to do so in other systems refer to

https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/Elisa-3#Programming

Programs required:

    - AVR8 Burn-O-Mat v2
     Link:    https://projects.gctronic.com/elisa3/programming/AVR-Burn-O-Mat-Windows7.zip
     This works on windows 10 has been tested

    - AVR Studio 4 Project
     Link:   https://projects.gctronic.com/elisa3/AvrStudio4Setup.exe
     This works on windows 10 has been tested

    After downloading, go to the github containing the Basic or Advanced Demo
    https://github.com/gctronic/elisa3_firmware_basic
    https://github.com/gctronic/elisa3_firmware_advanced.git

    each has unique dependencies that can be used as a start code to modify the elisa3.

Programming the Elisa3:

    When downloaded, Open AVR Studio 4, then open a Project look into the demo folder previously downloaded and look for the Elisa3-avr-studio.aps, this is the file that will open the
    project for you to work on,

    Multiple files will be opened, you can edit them and change values, from this program you will be able to compile the HEX file required for deploying on the elisa3.

    WinAVR needs to be installed on the system for AVR Studio to work.

    Follow this guide to get the links and step by step of how to do so

    Make sure you know where winAVR will be installed since you will need it.

    After that is installed, go to AVR Studio, click on the top left corner into Project --> Configuration Options
    This will open a small window, on the bottom left will be a small bottom down arrow, click it, then click on Custom Options
    In the external tools block, unselect Use AVR Toolchain
    then on the avr-gcc, click on the button to the right of it, and search for the path in your winAVR installation
        - WinAVR-20100110\bin\avr-gcc.exe
    then for make, click on the button to the right of it, and search for the path in your winAVR installation
        - WinAVR-20100110\utils\bin\make.exe

    After those steps are followed, you will be able to build your HEX file properly.

    After making changes to your code (This can be done directly on AVR Studio or on VScode) on the top left corner of AVR Studio click on Build --> Build
    or press F7 for shortcut.

    This will compile your code, if terminal displays build complete, then go to the location of the code and enter the folder named "default", in here you will find 
    Elisa3-avr-studio.hex this is the file you will need for following steps


Deploying on Elisa3:
    Connect and turn on the elisa3 to the computer using the USB cable
    press windows key and search for device manager
    The connected robot should appear as one item in the Ports(COM & LPT)
    Check what is the COM number of the connected robot (Each robot connected should have a different number)
    After you have the hex file available, open AVR8 Burn-O-Mat program
    click on Settings --> AVRDUDE on the top left corner. 
    In this window, change the port, select the com# that you found on the devices plugged to the computer
    If the com number is higher than the options available, just write on the box com + number "ex:com23"
    Click on Ok

    Then in flash click on file, search for your file on the "default" folder of your code then select the hex file named Elisa3-avr-studio.hex
    After this just click on the write button that is right below Flash.
    The program should start writing to the robot.

    If it fails, make sure com port is correct, make sure robot is connected and turned on
    Disconnecting and connecting usually works to solve most of the issues

    After flashing the program will show a signal that it has been flashed successfully. If modifications are made and required to re flash
    robot must be disconnected and connected again.
